        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h2>What is Underwater Hockey?</h2>
        <p>Underwater Hockey, also known as Octopush, is a fast paced underwater sport. The aim is to manoeuvre a lead puck
            across the bottom of a swimming pool into the opposing team's goal by propelling it with a hockey stick. There
            are 10 players on each team, with rolling subs so only 6 players are playing at any one time.</p>

        <p>The game starts with the puck on the bottom of the pool between the two teams. Then once play starts teams are free
            to swim anywhere in the play area. Scoring happens when the puck enters one of the teams goals, which are made
            from metal and span about half the width of the playing area. </p>

        <p>Our club is a member of the British Octopush Association (BOA) which is the governing body for underwater hockey
            in the UK - Their website is -
            <a href="https://www.gbuwh.co.uk">https://www.gbuwh.co.uk</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Why is it Great Exercise?</h3>
        <p>Most sports let you breath while you are playing. However in underwater hockey you need to hold your breath when
            diving down for the puck. While some people hold their breath for ages the real skill is knowing when to dive.
            You can then quickly tackle an opponent, pass the puck then resurface for a quick breath of air.</p>

        <h3>Do you do anything social?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! After training we usually head off down to the pub.</p>

        <h3>How did it start?</h3>
        <p>Underwater Hockey started in the United Kingdom in the fifties, bored divers wanted something do something over the
            winter. Originally the teams had 8 players (hence Octopush) but this has now reduced to 6 a side.</p>
        <p>From it's small beginnings many teams have formed in the UK and around the world, from New Zealand to Canada. </p>
        <p>You can find out more about
            <a href="http://history.cmas.org/hockey">the history</a> of the sport on the CMAS site</p>

        <h3>What are the rules?</h3>
        <p>You can have a look at the complete rules
            <a href="http://www.gbuwh.co.uk/UserFiles/File/Reference%20Area/Referee/Rules/BOA%20Rules%2011.4a.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Are there Competitions?</h3>
        <p>Of course! We compete in the Nautlius tournament and have also taken part in Valentines, Big Blue at Plymouth, Barbipush,
            Totton Mix and Match and Ladies Nationals. There are also international tournaments which some of the team
            have taken part in, including Parmacup in Italy and the Berlin Open in Germany.</p>

        <h3>Who are you? How did you start?</h3>
        <p>Islington Octopush (Underwater Hockey) Club started out over 40 years ago as a BSAC (British Sub-Aqua Club) Octopush
            team. We are now independent members of the British Octopush Association (BOA), but still have links with several
            diving clubs and many of our players continue to dive.
