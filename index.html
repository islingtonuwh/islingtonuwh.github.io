        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h2>What is Underwater Hockey?</h2>
        <p>Underwater Hockey, also known as Octopush is a fast paced underwater sport to manoeuvre a lead puck across the bottom
            of a swimming pool into the opposing team's goal by propelling it with a hockey stick. There are 10 players on
            each team, with rolling subs as only 6 can be playing at any one time.</p>

        <p>The games starts with the puck on the bottom of the pool between the two teams. Then once play starts teams are free
            to swim anywhere in the play area. Scoring happens when the puck enters one of the teams goals, which are made
            from metal and span about half the width of the playing area. </p>

        <h3>Why is it Great Exercise?</h3>
        <p>Most sports let you breath while you are playing. However in underwater hockey you need to hold your breath when
            diving down for the puck. While some people hold their breath for ages the real skill is knowing when to dive.
            You can then quickly tackle an opponent, pass the puck then resurface for a quick breath of air.</p>

        <h3>Do you do anything social?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! After training we usually head off down to the pub.</p>

        <h3>How did it start?</h3>
        <p>Underwater Hockey started in the United Kingdom in the fifties, bored divers wanted something do something over the
            winter. Originally the teams had 8 players (hence Octopush) but this has once reduced to 6 a side.</p>
        <p>From it's small beginnings many teams have formed in the UK and around the world, from New Zealand to Canada. There
            is even a belgian team.</p>

        <h3>What are the rules?</h3>
        <p>You can have a look at the complete rules <a href="http://www.gbuwh.co.uk/UserFiles/File/Reference%20Area/Referee/Rules/BOA%20Rules%2011.4a.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Are there Competitions?</h3>
        <p>Of Course! We compete in the British Octopush Association Nautlius tournament, as well as other games in London and
            occasionally overseas.</p>
